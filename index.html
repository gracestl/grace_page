				<br><h1>Pet Food Review</h1>
				<h2> ACANA Review </h2>
				<p> ACANA is the sister brand of Orijen, with both being made by Canadian manufacturer Champion Petfoods. If you’ve already read our review of Orijen dog food then you’ll know how reputable this manufacturer is, and it has to be said from the off that ACANA is a very good dog food.The caveat is Orijen is the better of the two, but when it comes to pet food “better” also means “pricier”.</p>
				<p>For our ACANA dog food review we’ll dig in to the Free-Run Poultry Recipe, which is a benchmark for all in the range.</p>

				<br><h6> This is the best dog food ever.</h6>
				<h2> What the marketing says </h2>
				<p> Champion Petfoods boldly state on their website “World’s Best Petfood”. There isn’t even the word probably (some of you may be familiar with the Carling beer slogan “Probably the best beer in the world).</p>
				<p> They claim both Orijen and Acana are made “For Pet Lovers, By Pet Lovers”. This surely makes you feel warm and fuzzy about their products, but as with any dog food they also make it for profit. That’s absolutely fine if quality goes hand in hand, which is thankfully the case.</p>
